### **Tips to Get the Most Out of the QFC Fuel Points Program**

**Tip #1: Plan Major Shopping Around Bonus Events**

One of the most effective strategies for maximizing your QFC fuel points is to make significant purchases during bonus events. These promotions often reward extra points for purchasing specific items, gift cards, or reaching certain spending thresholds. By timing your larger grocery runs around these events, you can significantly boost your points balance. For instance, buying gift cards during special promotions not only earns you bonus points but also adds value if you use those cards for future purchases or as gifts.

**Tip #2: Track Expiration Dates and Plan Usage Accordingly** 

QFC fuel points expire at the end of the following month, so monitoring your points balance and expiration dates is essential to avoid missing out on savings. Regularly check the QFC app or website to keep track of your points and expiration dates. You can plan your fill-ups strategically, using points before they expire for maximum savings. This awareness helps you stay on top of your rewards and ensures that you don’t lose valuable points that could have been used to reduce fuel expenses.

**Tip #3: Use the QFC App to Unlock Exclusive Promotions and Keep Tabs on Points** 

The QFC app is a valuable resource for managing your fuel points program. It provides real-time updates on your points balance, alerts for upcoming promotions, and access to digital coupons. By using the app, you can make informed decisions on when to shop and where to fill up based on your current points and any active promotions. The app also features a locator for participating fuel stations, making it easy to redeem your points conveniently.

**Tip #4: Stack Digital Coupons with Fuel Points for Additional Savings** 

QFC frequently offers digital coupons that provide discounts on grocery items. By stacking these digital coupons with your regular fuel points earnings, you can maximize your overall savings. Load the coupons directly through the QFC app before shopping, then apply them at checkout. This approach not only reduces your grocery costs but also allows you to accumulate points faster, especially if your purchases include items that are part of bonus point promotions.

**Tip #5: Utilize Pharmacy and Prescription Purchases** 

Earning points isn’t limited to grocery shopping; you can also accumulate fuel points when you fill prescriptions at participating QFC pharmacies. If you regularly use a QFC pharmacy, this is an easy way to earn additional points that contribute to fuel savings. Consider transferring prescriptions to QFC to take advantage of this benefit, and check for any promotions that might offer bonus points on pharmacy items.

**Tip #6: Buy Gift Cards to Rack Up Bonus Points** 

QFC frequently offers bonus points for buying select gift cards. This can be a smart way to increase your points quickly, especially during special promotions. If you have upcoming birthdays, holidays, or other events where you’d typically buy gift cards, purchasing them from QFC allows you to earn fuel points while buying a gift you already planned to give. Some gift cards can even be used to pay for essentials like dining or online shopping, adding even more value.

**Tip #7: Pool Points Across Family Members with a Shared Account** 

If multiple family members shop at QFC, consider linking your accounts so you can accumulate fuel points together. By pooling points, you reach higher savings tiers faster, allowing for greater discounts at the pump. This can be especially helpful for larger households, as it consolidates points and maximizes the benefit for each fill-up. Just ensure everyone is on the same page regarding point expiration and promotion periods.

**Tip #8: Take Advantage of Double Fuel Point Weekends** 

QFC occasionally offers double fuel point weekends, where every dollar spent earns twice the usual points. Planning your shopping trips around these weekends allows you to accelerate your points earning significantly, especially if you purchase higher-value items or stock up on household staples. Keep an eye out for these special weekends, as they’re an ideal time to boost your points with minimal extra effort.

**Tip #9: Use Alternative Payment Methods That Offer Rewards** 

If you use a credit card that provides cash back or rewards on grocery purchases, you can further maximize your savings by earning points both through QFC and your credit card. This stackable approach lets you double-dip on rewards—fuel points from QFC and rewards from your credit card issuer. Be sure to pay off your balance to avoid interest fees, as this can negate the benefit of any rewards earned.

**Tip #10: Plan Multiple Smaller Purchases to Reach Bonus Tiers** 

If you're close to a fuel point bonus tier but don't need a major grocery trip, consider making smaller purchases to reach the threshold. Items like pantry staples, cleaning supplies, or household goods can help you bridge the gap. This approach is especially useful if you’re near a milestone but prefer not to make a big purchase.

### **QFC App Features**

The QFC app offers a range of features to enhance your fuel rewards experience:

### **Tips to Maximize Your Savings with the Pump Perks Program**

The Pump Perks program at Shop 'n Save offers shoppers significant savings on fuel by rewarding them for their grocery purchases. To make the most of this program, it's essential to adopt some savvy strategies and be aware of specific opportunities. Below are detailed ways to maximize your savings and Pump Perks accumulation.

** Tip #1: Stack Your Purchases for Maximum Perk Accumulation**

One of the easiest ways to optimize your Pump Perks earnings is by stacking your purchases. Instead of making smaller, frequent grocery trips, plan your shopping to spend in increments of $50 per transaction. For every $50 spent, you earn 10 cents off per gallon, so larger purchases help you accumulate discounts more quickly. For instance, if you spend $150 in one trip, you immediately earn 30 cents off per gallon in one transaction. This method is particularly useful if you’re stocking up on pantry staples or buying in bulk.

If your weekly grocery needs are smaller, consider consolidating several weeks' worth of shopping into one big trip to hit that $50 threshold multiple times. This strategy can significantly boost your rewards compared to spending the same amount over multiple smaller visits, which may not all reach the $50 increment.

**Tip #2: Take Advantage of Special Promotions and Bonus Events**

Shop 'n Save regularly offers special promotions where you can earn extra perks on specific products or during particular time periods. These bonus events often coincide with holidays, seasonal sales, or partner brand promotions. During these times, you may earn double or even triple perks on certain items. To make the most of these opportunities, it's important to stay informed by signing up for promotional emails, checking in-store advertisements, or visiting the Shop 'n Save website frequently.

Being aware of these promotions allows you to plan your shopping trips accordingly. For example, during a "double perks" event, your $50 grocery purchase would earn you 20 cents off per gallon instead of the regular 10 cents. These events can lead to significant perk accumulation in a short amount of time, so it's crucial to keep an eye out for them.

**Tip #3: Maximize Fuel Savings by Filling Larger Tanks**

When redeeming Pump Perks, you can use your savings on up to 30 gallons of fuel per transaction. To maximize the value of your discounts, try to fill up when your gas tank is nearly empty, or better yet, fill larger vehicles like trucks or SUVs, which can hold closer to the 30-gallon limit. Additionally, if your vehicle has a smaller tank, you can bring extra gas cans to fill up or coordinate with family members or friends to fill multiple cars in a single transaction.

For example, if you've earned 40 cents off per gallon and you fill a 30-gallon tank, you're saving $12 on that fill-up alone. This strategy allows you to make the most of your perks by ensuring every gallon benefits from the discount, rather than only filling a partial tank.

**Tip #4: Utilize the Sunoco App for Efficient Reward Management**

Shop 'n Save partners with Sunoco for its Pump Perks program, and by linking your Pump Perks account to the Sunoco mobile app, you gain more control over your rewards. The app allows you to check your perk balance, track your savings, and keep an eye on expiration dates, ensuring you never miss out on using your perks before they expire. The app also provides the convenience of paying at the pump directly from your phone, eliminating the need to swipe your rewards card.

By using the app, you’ll have an up-to-date view of your perks balance and can better plan when to redeem your rewards for maximum savings. This level of convenience ensures you're always in control of your fuel savings, and the app will notify you about special fuel promotions that can further enhance your savings.

**Tip #5: Shop During Bonus Events to Earn Faster**

Bonus events are one of the best ways to accelerate your perk accumulation. Shop 'n Save frequently hosts these events where certain products or entire categories (like dairy or household items) offer double or even triple perks. Planning your grocery shopping around these events can drastically reduce your fuel costs over time. The key is to be flexible with your shopping list—if you know a bonus event is coming up, adjust your purchases accordingly to take full advantage of the extra perks.

For example, if there’s a double-perk promotion on snacks and you spend $50, you'll earn 20 cents off per gallon instead of the standard 10 cents. These events are ideal for larger shopping trips or stock-up occasions, ensuring you maximize the perks earned from each dollar spent.

**Tip #6: Keep Track of Expiration Dates to Avoid Losing Perks**

Your Pump Perks expire 60 days after they are earned, so it’s crucial to keep track of expiration dates to avoid losing valuable savings. By using the Sunoco app or checking your balance on the Shop 'n Save website, you can stay on top of how long you have to use your perks. It's easy to lose track of these dates, especially if you're saving up for a large fill-up, so setting reminders or checking your balance regularly ensures you're using your perks before they expire.

Expiring perks represent missed savings, so making sure you stay informed about your perks balance is key to getting the most out of the program. Redeeming perks before they expire ensures that you’re always benefiting from the purchases you've made.

**Tip #7: Spread Out Your Savings for Consistent Discounts**

While it might be tempting to let your perks build up to achieve a massive discount on one fill-up, sometimes it's more practical to spread out your savings. Gas prices fluctuate, and by using your perks consistently, you can ensure that you're always saving on fuel, even if prices rise. Redeeming smaller amounts of perks more frequently allows you to continually benefit from the Pump Perks program without waiting for a perfect time to cash in a large amount.

This strategy is particularly useful when gas prices are expected to increase, as waiting for a bigger discount might not be as beneficial as consistently saving on every fill-up. Using your perks regularly helps maintain a steady stream of savings throughout the year.

**Tip #8: Leverage Gift Cards for Additional Perks**

Many grocery stores, including Shop 'n Save, offer additional perks for purchasing gift cards to popular retailers and restaurants. Purchasing gift cards for places you already shop or dine at can be a clever way to boost your Pump Perks balance without spending extra money. For example, if you buy a $100 gift card for a retailer, you might earn extra perks on that purchase, helping you reach your next fuel discount faster.

By combining gift card purchases with your regular grocery shopping, you can accumulate perks more efficiently and without needing to increase your out-of-pocket spending. This strategy is especially useful around holidays or when gift card promotions are running.

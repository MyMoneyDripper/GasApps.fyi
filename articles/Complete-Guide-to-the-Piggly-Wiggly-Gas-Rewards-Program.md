### **Tips for Maximizing Earnings with the Piggly Wiggly Gas Rewards Program**

1.  **Shop During Bonus Events:** Piggly Wiggly frequently runs
    promotions that offer bonus points on certain items or during
    specific time frames, such as holidays or weekends. Keep an eye on
    weekly flyers, in-store signage, and the mobile app to know when
    these events are happening. Timing your shopping trips during these
    periods can help you earn points much faster. For example, a
    promotion might offer double points for a limited time, allowing you
    to rack up savings with minimal extra effort.

2.  **Focus on Bonus Items:** Certain products often offer extra points
    beyond the usual rate. These bonus items are typically featured in
    weekly ads or through the store's digital promotions. Plan your
    shopping list around these items to maximize point accumulation.
    Even if they aren't products you typically buy, stocking up on
    household staples or non-perishable goods during these promotions
    can lead to significant savings on future fuel purchases.

3.  **Purchase Gift Cards for Extra Points:** Piggly Wiggly often
    rewards customers with additional points for purchasing gift cards.
    If you're planning to shop at other retailers, dine at restaurants,
    or buy gifts, consider purchasing gift cards at Piggly Wiggly first
    to earn extra points. This is an easy way to boost your point total
    without changing your spending habits, especially during holidays or
    birthdays.

4.  **Link Your Account to Digital Offers:** Take advantage of the
    Piggly Wiggly app by linking your rewards account with available
    digital coupons and offers. This not only helps you save on
    groceries but also provides extra opportunities to earn bonus
    points. Sync your account with any ongoing promotions for a seamless
    shopping experience and to avoid missing out on valuable
    point-earning opportunities.

5.  **Redeem Points When Fuel Prices Are High:** Timing your point
    redemption can make a big difference in your savings. If possible,
    try to redeem your gas rewards during times when fuel prices are
    higher, as your points will have a greater impact on the overall
    cost per gallon. Additionally, filling up when your tank is nearly
    empty allows you to maximize the number of gallons you save on,
    ensuring you get the most out of your rewards.

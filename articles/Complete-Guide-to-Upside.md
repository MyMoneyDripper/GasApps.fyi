[Upside](https://upside.app.link/2PVBC) is a cashback app that helps you save money on gas, groceries, and dining out. It claims to give you real cashback, not points or credits.

But, does it really work?

In this review, I’ll cut through the fluff and show you what Upside really offers, how it works, and whether it’s a solid way to put more money in your pocket.

### What is the Upside App?

Upside is a cashback app that helps you save money on everyday purchases like gas, groceries, and dining. Unlike typical rewards programs that offer points, Upside gives you actual cashback. This means you can transfer your earnings straight to your PayPal or bank account.

Before making a purchase, you simply claim an offer in the app, shop as usual, and pay with a linked debit or credit card. Your cashback is credited once the transaction is verified, making it quick and easy to see your savings grow.

Upside's model benefits both users and participating businesses. You save money on your regular purchases, while businesses gain loyal customers. The more you use it, the more you earn—helping you put extra money back in your pocket with minimal effort.

### Why Upside App Stands Out

Upside stands out because it offers real cashback instead of points or credits. With Upside, you can cash out directly to your bank, PayPal, or get gift cards. This makes it easier to see and use your savings compared to other apps that offer complex point systems.

Unlike many cashback apps that focus mainly on online shopping, Upside targets everyday spending like gas, groceries, and dining. It often offers higher cashback rates in these categories. However, some other apps may have broader options for online purchases.

### Features

Upside offers a range of features that make saving money on everyday purchases simple and rewarding. Here’s a closer look at what you can expect:

- **Cashback Offers**: Earn cashback on purchases made at participating gas stations, grocery stores, and restaurants. The cashback rates vary, with some categories offering as much as 45% back.
- **Easy Redemption**: Cash out your earnings directly to your bank account, PayPal, or as gift cards to popular retailers. This flexibility means you can access your savings whenever you want.
- **Referral Program**: Share your unique referral code with friends and earn bonuses when they join and make purchases. You'll continue to earn a small percentage for every gallon of gas they buy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is designed to make finding and claiming offers easy. It provides a map of nearby deals, clear offer details, and simple navigation.
- **Check-In and Receipt Upload Options**: For gas stations and restaurants, you can use the Check-In feature for instant verification. Alternatively, you can upload a photo of your receipt to claim cashback.
- **Combine Savings**: Upside allows you to stack cashback with other coupons, discounts, and loyalty programs, giving you even more savings on each purchase.
- **Regular Updates**: The app frequently updates offers, so there’s always something new to save on. This means more opportunities to earn cashback in your area.

- **Combine with Other Discounts**: Take advantage of coupons, loyalty programs, or sales to stack savings on top of your Upside cashback.

### Who Benefits Most from the Upside App?

Upside is designed for a wide range of users who want to save money on everyday purchases. This cashback app caters to anyone looking to reduce costs without changing their spending habits. Here’s a closer look at who benefits most:

- **Frequent Drivers:** Upside offers up to 25¢ per gallon cash back at over 30,000 gas stations across the U.S. This makes it ideal for people who drive regularly for work or errands. Over time, these savings can add up, providing significant relief from rising gas prices.

- **Restaurant Goers:** For individuals and families who love dining out, Upside provides up to 45% cash back at participating restaurants. Whether it’s a quick meal or a family dinner, the app helps users save on meals they already plan to purchase.

- **Grocery Shoppers:** Grocery shopping becomes more rewarding with Upside’s cash back offers of up to 30%. While the selection may vary by location, this feature is a great way for families and individuals to cut costs on essential purchases.

- **Budget-Conscious Consumers:** If you’re looking to maximize savings on everyday purchases, Upside is perfect. By earning cash back on items you already buy, you can effectively lower your expenses without changing your spending habits.

- **Travelers:** Travelers benefit from Upside by finding discounts on gas and dining in unfamiliar areas. The app helps locate participating businesses, making it a convenient way to save money on the go.

### Combine Upside with Other Loyalty Programs

One of Upside’s most appealing features is its ability to stack cash back with other loyalty programs. This means you can combine Upside savings with rewards from gas stations, grocery stores, or restaurants to maximize your benefits. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when combining these offers.

Upside allows users to earn cash back while still using their favorite loyalty cards or discounts. For example, you can use a gas station loyalty card like Shell Fuel Rewards or BPme while also claiming cash back through the app. This stacking feature lets you enjoy the best of both worlds.

While stacking is generally allowed, some limitations may apply. For example, combining discounts may lower the percentage of cash back offered by Upside. Always check the terms and conditions of both programs to understand how much you’ll earn from each transaction.

To get the most from stacking, claim your Upside offer before making a purchase and ensure your loyalty card is applied at checkout. Regularly review the app for updates, as some businesses may change their policies regarding combined offers.

By combining Upside with other loyalty programs, you can significantly increase your savings on everyday purchases. Just be mindful of restrictions to ensure you’re getting the best deal possible.

### Is Upside Safe?

Upside takes user safety seriously by protecting your personal information. The app only collects what is needed to verify purchases, such as partial card details. Unlike many other platforms, it does not sell user data, so your information stays private.

Upside also uses strong security measures, including regular audits and careful vetting of third-party partners. This helps ensure your personal and financial data is handled securely and that you can use the app with confidence.

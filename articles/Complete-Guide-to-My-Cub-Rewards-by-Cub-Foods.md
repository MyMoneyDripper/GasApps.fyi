### **Tips to Get the Most Out of the My Cub Rewards Program**

**Tip #1: Focus on High-Point Purchases**

Maximizing your My Cub Rewards starts with understanding which purchases yield the highest points. Certain items and promotions offer bonus points, typically highlighted in weekly ads or store signage. These products, often staples like dairy, meat, or household essentials, allow you to accumulate points faster without purchasing items you don’t need. Taking advantage of these bonus-point items during promotions can significantly boost your monthly points balance. By planning your shopping trips around these high-point products, you’ll increase your fuel savings without extra effort or cost. Additionally, check for seasonal promotions tied to holidays or events; these periods often offer limited-time bonuses that can multiply your points, making it easier to reach higher rewards thresholds. With careful planning, you can leverage these opportunities to maximize the value you get from every dollar spent.

**Tip #2: Plan for Monthly Redemption**

The My Cub Rewards points expire at the end of each month, so it’s essential to strategize your fuel purchases around this expiration date. One effective approach is to keep track of your fuel gauge and redeem points when your tank is close to empty, allowing you to utilize the maximum discount per gallon. Since My Cub Rewards allows you to save significantly on each gallon, using your points on larger fill-ups can yield the greatest savings. Avoid missing out on points by setting a reminder toward the end of each month to redeem any accumulated rewards. Many users find that a monthly schedule of larger grocery trips, paired with a fuel redemption, helps them stay on top of point expirations while getting consistent savings on both groceries and gas.

**Tip #3: Combine Grocery and Pharmacy Purchases**

By consolidating your grocery and pharmacy purchases at Cub Foods, you can earn rewards points on both essentials and prescriptions, maximizing your rewards potential. Each qualifying prescription refill adds to your points balance, allowing you to reach fuel rewards thresholds faster. This approach is particularly beneficial for households with regular prescriptions, as each pharmacy visit contributes to your rewards. Coordinating grocery shopping with pharmacy pickups also saves time and streamlines your trips, making it easier to accumulate and track points in one place. Over time, this habit will lead to consistent rewards, and you may find yourself accumulating points faster than expected. Additionally, keep an eye out for special pharmacy-related promotions that offer extra points for refills; these can be an excellent opportunity to earn bonus rewards on necessary purchases.

**Tip #4: Use the Mobile App for Real-Time Tracking**

The My Cub Rewards app is a powerful tool for anyone looking to maximize their rewards. By using the app to track your points balance and monitor upcoming expiration dates, you can stay informed and make smarter purchasing decisions. The app also notifies you of bonus point promotions, fuel discounts, and other savings opportunities, helping you plan ahead for bigger savings. Furthermore, the app provides a convenient way to locate participating fuel stations where you can redeem your points, ensuring that you never miss an opportunity to save. Regularly checking the app also allows you to manage your points effectively, reducing the chances of missing out on any potential savings. With all your rewards information at your fingertips, the app simplifies the process and helps you stay in control of your rewards journey.

**Tip #5: Participate in Bonus Point Events**

Throughout the year, Cub Foods offers special events that allow customers to earn double or triple points on select items. These events are typically announced through weekly ads, the Cub Foods website, or the My Cub Rewards app. Taking advantage of these promotions can lead to substantial point accumulation in a short period, especially if you plan your shopping around these high-point periods. By stocking up on frequently used items during these bonus events, you can ensure you’re maximizing the rewards potential of each trip. Bonus events are particularly advantageous for larger households or frequent shoppers, as they provide an easy way to multiply your rewards without significant extra spending.

**Tip #6: Stack Savings with Digital Coupons**

Cub Foods provides digital coupons that can be paired with your My Cub Rewards purchases, allowing for an additional layer of savings. Checking the Cub Foods website or the My Cub Rewards app for digital coupons before shopping enables you to save on items that may also earn points. For example, if a particular product offers a point bonus and has a digital coupon, combining both savings opportunities maximizes your financial benefit. This method requires a bit of planning, but the payoff can be substantial, especially when grocery prices rise. Regularly reviewing available digital coupons and integrating them into your shopping routine is a simple way to amplify your rewards.

**Tip #7: Track Promotions in the Weekly Flyer**

Cub Foods publishes a weekly flyer that lists current promotions, including items with bonus points. Reviewing this flyer before each shopping trip helps you identify products that will yield the highest point returns. Adjusting your shopping list to include these high-point items is an effective way to accumulate rewards faster. Plus, the flyer often highlights seasonal items and holiday specials that offer limited-time point boosts. Incorporating these promotions into your shopping strategy is a great way to make every dollar go further, while also allowing you to take full advantage of the My Cub Rewards program.

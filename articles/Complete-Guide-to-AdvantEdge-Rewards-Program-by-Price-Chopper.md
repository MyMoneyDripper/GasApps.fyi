### **What is the AdvantEdge Rewards Program?**

The Price Chopper AdvantEdge Rewards Program is a loyalty initiative designed to reward customers for their regular purchases at Price Chopper, Market 32, and Market Bistro. For every dollar spent, you earn 1 point, and these points can be redeemed for various rewards. The program replaced previous loyalty initiatives, streamlining the experience to offer easier ways to earn, track, and redeem points. It’s an excellent way for shoppers to save money on everyday groceries or gas. By integrating the program with the Price Chopper app, members can keep track of their earnings, access special offers, and manage their accounts digitally.

Beyond basic savings, the program appeals to a wide range of customers with the flexibility to donate points to charitable causes or redeem points for non-grocery-related benefits like magazine subscriptions. For customers who purchase gas regularly or those who appreciate the opportunity to support their community, this program delivers a multi-faceted reward system.

### **AdvantEdge Rewards Program Features**

* **Seamless Enrollment:** Signing up for AdvantEdge is straightforward and free. Customers can enroll online, via the Price Chopper app, or in-store by providing their basic information. Once signed up, every purchase made will automatically accrue points when using your AdvantEdge card or app.  
* **Versatile Redemption Options:** You have a range of redemption choices. Customers can redeem points for grocery discounts, fuel savings, charitable donations, or even for entries into sweepstakes or exclusive deals. The program's flexibility caters to a variety of preferences, so shoppers aren’t limited to one reward type.  
* **Special Promotions and Events:** The program regularly offers bonus point opportunities, especially during special shopping events or product promotions. For example, purchasing gift cards during promotional periods can net you additional points, sometimes up to 4x the regular amount.  
* **Fuel Savings Integration:** One of the most attractive features of the program is the gas discount option. Customers can redeem 100 points for 5¢ off per gallon at participating Sunoco stations, which can be used on up to 20 gallons per visit. This is a great way to offset rising gas prices and increase the value of each dollar spent at the grocery store.  
* **Track and Manage Points:** Through the Price Chopper mobile app, members can easily track their point balance, monitor promotional offers, and check transaction history. This level of transparency ensures that customers know exactly how close they are to earning rewards.

### **How to Earn AdvantEdge Rewards Points**

The key to maximizing your rewards is knowing how to accumulate points efficiently. Here’s how you can earn points:

* **Grocery Purchases:** For every dollar spent at Price Chopper, Market 32, or Market Bistro, you earn 1 point. This applies to almost all purchases, though some exceptions (like gift cards and alcohol) may apply.  
* **Bonus Point Promotions:** Keep an eye out for special promotions where you can earn extra points. For example, during certain times of the year, buying specific products or categories of items might earn you 2x or 3x the points. Purchasing gift cards also regularly earns extra points.  
* **Seasonal Promotions:** During the holiday season, Price Chopper often runs campaigns where customers can earn additional points on items like turkeys, hams, or other holiday-related purchases. These are excellent opportunities to boost your points quickly.

### **How to Get the Most out of AdvantEdge Rewards**

Maximizing the value of the AdvantEdge program requires strategy. Here are a few tips to help you optimize your point accumulation and redemption:

**Tip #1: Use the Price Chopper App to Stay Informed and Organized**

One of the most valuable tools for maximizing the AdvantEdge program is the Price Chopper mobile app. By downloading and regularly using the app, you’ll get real-time updates on your point balance, current promotions, and exclusive digital coupons. The app helps you stay organized by allowing you to create a shopping list, track which items are offering bonus points, and see how much you’ve saved.

Beyond tracking points, the app will also notify you when points are close to expiring, ensuring you never miss the opportunity to redeem your hard-earned rewards. Additionally, some coupons and special offers are only available through the app, giving you an edge over shoppers who don’t use it.

**Tip #2: Stack Offers and Coupons for Maximum Savings**

For savvy shoppers, combining different offers is one of the most effective strategies to maximize savings. Here’s how it works: Price Chopper often runs promotions where you can earn extra points by purchasing specific products, such as doubling or tripling points on certain brands. Additionally, the app and the Price Chopper website frequently offer digital coupons. By using both the AdvantEdge points system and stacking these digital coupons, you can save even more on your purchases.

For instance, if a particular product is offering 3x points, and you have a digital coupon for the same item, you’ll get both a discount at checkout and accumulate extra points. Over time, these small savings add up, helping you make the most out of your grocery shopping experience. Make sure you also check out special weekly offers that sometimes provide bonus points on bulk or seasonal items.

**Tip #3: Purchase Gift Cards During Promotional Events**

A lesser-known but highly effective strategy for increasing your AdvantEdge points balance is buying gift cards during promotional events. Price Chopper regularly runs campaigns where purchasing select gift cards (such as those for restaurants, online retailers, or entertainment services) will earn you up to **4x points**. While buying gift cards may not seem like a way to save immediately, it’s a great hack if you plan to use those gift cards anyway—for example, purchasing gift cards as holiday gifts or even for personal use to cover future expenses at your favorite retailers.

During these promotions, you’re essentially earning points on money you would have spent anyway. For example, if you purchase a $100 gift card and there’s a 4x points promotion, you’ll earn 400 AdvantEdge points, which could give you **$4 off groceries or 20¢ off per gallon of gas** at participating Sunoco stations.

**Tip #4: Redeem Points for Fuel Savings Regularly**

If you’re someone who drives frequently, using your AdvantEdge points for fuel savings can result in substantial long-term savings. While 5¢ off per gallon for 100 points may not seem like a lot initially, this discount can be applied to up to 20 gallons of gas per fill-up, allowing you to save as much as $1 per fill-up if you accumulate 1,000 points.

Since points accumulate with every grocery purchase, it’s easy to build up enough points to make a noticeable difference in your fuel budget. By combining grocery shopping with gift card purchases and promotional events, you can significantly reduce your fuel costs over time. It’s also important to note that Sunoco frequently partners with Price Chopper for special deals, so keep an eye out for promotions where the value of each point is increased.

**Tip #5: Time Your Redemptions for Big Purchases or Special Occasions**

While redeeming points for everyday grocery shopping is helpful, you can maximize the benefit by saving your points for larger purchases. For instance, you might choose to redeem your points during the holiday season when you're purchasing a significant amount of food and drinks for gatherings. This is especially effective during times when Price Chopper offers extra points for certain holiday items (such as turkeys, hams, or beverages), allowing you to both save and earn additional points for future use.

You can also redeem points for special events like back-to-school shopping or large family gatherings, where your total grocery bill may be higher than usual. Using your points strategically during these times helps you make the most out of your rewards.

**Tip #6: Pay Attention to Expiration Dates and Special Offers**

One of the most common ways shoppers lose out on potential rewards is by letting their points expire. AdvantEdge points do have an expiration date, so it’s crucial to monitor your point balance and expiration timelines via the app or website. Periodically check the expiration date of your points to ensure you use them before they expire.

Additionally, keep a close eye on special offers and limited-time promotions, such as seasonal bonus points or exclusive product deals. These promotions can help you earn points faster and make the most of your everyday shopping routine. Remember, the best way to avoid losing points is to use them regularly, even if it’s just for small discounts on your groceries.

**Tip #7: Consider Donating Points to Charities**

For those who are community-minded, the AdvantEdge program allows you to donate your points to local charities. This is an excellent option if you have accumulated a significant number of points but don’t need to use them for yourself. Whether you’re passionate about food banks, shelters, or health organizations, donating your points can help Price Chopper contribute to a range of causes that benefit the community.

This is particularly useful for people who feel they don’t need immediate savings on groceries or gas, but still want to make a positive impact with their points. It’s a unique and thoughtful way to give back while still benefiting from the AdvantEdge program.

**Tip #8: Shop During Double or Triple Point Days**

Throughout the year, Price Chopper often offers “double points” or even “triple points” on select items or categories. These promotions allow you to earn points at a much faster rate. Stock up on household staples or non-perishable items during these events to maximize your points and savings. Pairing these offers with your regular grocery shopping can provide a significant boost to your point balance.

To ensure you don’t miss out on these promotions, sign up for Price Chopper’s newsletter or regularly check the app for updates. Since these promotions may be limited to certain dates or categories, advanced planning can help you maximize your points.

**Tip #9: Enroll in Price Chopper’s AdvantEdge e-coupons**

Another tip to get more out of the program is to sign up for Price Chopper’s AdvantEdge e-coupons. These coupons are frequently offered through email, in-store, or via the mobile app. These digital coupons can be stacked with AdvantEdge Rewards promotions, allowing you to earn points and save on your overall purchase at the same time. Unlike traditional paper coupons, digital e-coupons can be applied instantly at checkout, making it convenient for tech-savvy shoppers.

Additionally, look out for special digital coupons that may give you bonus points on certain items. These types of promotions are an easy way to rack up extra points quickly and maximize your rewards over time.

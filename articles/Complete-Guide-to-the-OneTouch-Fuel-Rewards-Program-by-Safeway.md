    dollar spent.

    product bonus point offers.

### Tips for Maximizing Earnings with the OneTouch Fuel Rewards Program

-   **Buy Gift Cards for Double Points**: Get Double Points by Buying
    Gift Cards: Buying gift cards is one of the simplest ways to
    increase your fuel savings. Select gift cards from Safeway earn two
    points for every dollar spent. Think about getting gift cards for
    services or businesses you already use, like restaurants, Amazon, or
    internet subscriptions, to take advantage of the double points and
    essentially prepay for items you would have bought anyway.

-   **Take Advantage of Bonus Point Promotions**: Safeway regularly
    offers promos that let you accumulate extra points for particular
    products or categories. Weekly ads and the Safeway app frequently
    feature these deals. You can increase your point earnings without
    going over your budget by organizing your shopping trips around
    these deals.

-   **Save Points for Larger Fill-Ups**: Utilizing your points when
    you\'re almost empty makes sense because fuel discounts are applied
    per gallon. In this manner, you can save as much money as possible
    on a bigger fuel volume. Additionally, keep in mind that you can
    redeem points in increments, so your discount per gallon (up to \$1
    off per gallon) will increase as you accumulate more points.

-   **Shop During Special Events**: Keep an eye out for Safeway\'s
    seasonal promotions and special shopping events, such as double or
    triple point weekends. These events give you more opportunities to
    earn points, enabling you to accumulate points more quickly. Making
    well-informed purchases during these times will help you save as
    much fuel as possible the next month.

-   **Link Family Accounts to Pool Points**: Safeway lets several family
    members link their accounts, so you can combine your points. If more
    than one person in your household shops at Safeway, linking accounts
    will help you earn points more quickly, which will eventually
    translate into larger savings at the pump.

### **Tips to Maximize Your Savings with Shaw’s For U™ Program**

Making the most out of Shaw’s For U™ program can unlock impressive savings on groceries, fuel, and more. By adopting these strategies, you can significantly enhance the value of your shopping experience.

**Tip 1: Check for Bonus Offers Regularly**

One of the quickest ways to increase your rewards balance is by staying vigilant for bonus point opportunities. Shaw’s frequently runs promotions where shoppers can earn double or even triple points on select products. These offers are generally time-sensitive, so checking the app, store flyers, or Shaw’s website regularly ensures you won’t miss out. Bonus offers may also apply to seasonal items or products tied to specific promotions, so it’s essential to remain updated. Being proactive and integrating bonus offers into your shopping routine can allow you to accumulate points much faster, speeding up the process toward redeeming rewards.

**Tip 2: Clip Digital Coupons Before Shopping**

Shaw’s For U™ program offers an array of digital coupons that you can conveniently clip before heading to the store. Coupons can provide both instant savings and bonus points on particular products. By checking for available coupons before each shopping trip, you can maximize discounts on items you already intend to buy. It’s also helpful to categorize coupons by product type or brand for easier access while shopping. Many users find it beneficial to combine these digital coupons with other promotions or store sales, multiplying savings and points earnings. Additionally, these coupons often align with personalized offers based on your shopping history, ensuring that you're saving on the items most relevant to you.

**Tip 3: Shop During Double-Point Events**

Shaw’s frequently holds double or triple-point events where shoppers can accumulate points much faster. These events typically happen during holidays or special sales periods and may be advertised well in advance through the Shaw’s website or mobile app. Planning your larger shopping trips during these events allows you to maximize the points you earn without changing your purchasing habits. For example, stocking up on pantry staples or household goods during a double-point event can significantly boost your rewards balance. These points can then be redeemed for future savings, ensuring that each shopping trip contributes more toward long-term benefits.

**Tip 4: Redeem Points When Gas Prices Are High**

Redeeming your points strategically is one of the best ways to maximize savings, particularly when it comes to fuel. Since gas prices fluctuate, it’s wise to monitor local gas stations and redeem points when prices are elevated. Shaw’s For U™ program allows you to redeem points for up to $1 off per gallon, which can add up to substantial savings if you wait until prices are high. You can redeem points for discounts on up to 25 gallons of fuel in one transaction, so timing your point usage around price hikes means more impactful savings. For frequent drivers or those planning long trips, this approach offers the greatest value.

**Tip 5: Track Your Points and Expiration Dates**

Like many rewards programs, Shaw’s For U™ points have expiration dates, meaning that if not redeemed in time, they can expire and you may lose the savings you've accumulated. By tracking your points through the Shaw’s app or website, you can ensure that you never miss a redemption opportunity. The platform offers easy-to-use tools that show your points balance, upcoming expiration dates, and rewards available. Setting reminders for when points are nearing expiration can help you prioritize when and how to use them, ensuring that you always extract the maximum value. Additionally, monitoring point accumulation enables you to plan larger redemptions strategically, whether for groceries or fuel.

**Tip 6: Plan Bulk Purchases Strategically**

For shoppers who tend to buy in bulk or make larger, less frequent grocery trips, Shaw's For U™ program offers a great opportunity to increase rewards in a single transaction. You can pair bulk shopping with double-point events or specific bonus offers to accumulate a significant number of points in one go. When bulk buying pantry staples or non-perishable items, you can maximize the return on each purchase and save on future trips. This tactic is particularly effective for households with high consumption needs or those who like to stock up during sales.

**Tip 7: Combine In-Store Sales with Points and Coupons**

To really stretch your budget, it’s a smart strategy to combine Shaw’s in-store sales with points accumulation and digital coupons. Many shoppers overlook how effectively these three elements can work together. By aligning your grocery trips with weekly store promotions, you not only save on items that are already discounted but also accumulate points faster and enjoy additional savings through clipped coupons. Savvy shoppers who plan ahead by reviewing weekly sales and coupon offerings in advance are often able to enjoy substantial savings across their entire grocery bill.

**Tip 8: Look for Personalized Deals on Big-Ticket Items**

One of the advantages of Shaw’s For U™ program is its ability to provide personalized deals based on your shopping history. If you regularly buy higher-ticket items such as meat, seafood, or alcohol, you’re likely to receive targeted offers that help you save more on these purchases. Keep an eye out for these personalized deals, especially on products where savings can significantly impact your budget. Personalized offers are typically found under your account, both on the Shaw’s website and in the app. By planning your shopping around these tailored deals, you can make the most of the program’s customized savings opportunities.

**Tip 9: Consider Group Purchases for Maximized Points**

Another useful strategy for frequent shoppers is organizing group purchases with friends or family. If you know others who shop at Shaw’s, you can plan to make larger purchases together, taking advantage of sales, double-point events, and bonus offers. By pooling your grocery needs, you’ll reach point thresholds faster, leading to quicker rewards redemptions. This is an excellent option for families or shared households, where combining purchases can lead to enhanced savings for everyone involved.

**Tip 10: Use the Shaw’s Mobile App for Convenience**

The Shaw’s For U™ mobile app offers many tools to help you stay organized and maximize your savings. Through the app, you can access personalized offers, view your points balance, track upcoming double-point events, and clip digital coupons. The app also provides real-time updates on ongoing promotions, making it easy to adjust your shopping plans on the go. For those who like a seamless experience, using the app at checkout ensures your points and coupons are automatically applied, streamlining the process and helping you stay on top of your rewards. You can even manage grocery lists, ensuring that you don’t miss any opportunities for savings.

**Tip 11: Personalized Offers and Exclusive Benefits**

One of the standout features of Shaw's For U™ program is the ability to access personalized offers. These deals are based on your shopping habits and can offer significant savings on products you frequently buy. By reviewing these offers regularly, you can ensure that you’re making the most of the program.

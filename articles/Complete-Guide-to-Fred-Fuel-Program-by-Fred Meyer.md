### **Tips to Get the Most Out of the Fred Meyer Fuel Points Program**

**Tip #1: Take Advantage of Bonus Point Promotions** 

Fred Meyer frequently offers bonus point promotions on select items, especially during holidays and seasonal events. These promotions might include double or triple points on certain grocery products, allowing you to accelerate your point accumulation. Planning your shopping around these bonus point promotions is a great way to maximize savings. If you’re purchasing holiday items or stocking up on household essentials, look for items with higher point values. Checking Fred Meyer’s weekly flyer or app before you shop can also reveal items with bonus points, helping you strategically choose products to boost your rewards.

**Tip #2: Stack Gift Card Purchases** 

One of the fastest ways to accumulate points is by purchasing gift cards, which often come with bonus point offers, such as 2x or 4x points. This can be particularly beneficial if you’re buying gift cards for other stores or dining establishments, as you’ll earn points without adding to your grocery expenses. For example, if you frequently dine out or shop online, purchasing a gift card for those activities through Fred Meyer will earn you points without spending more than usual. Make sure to watch for gift card promotions during holidays or special occasions, as these can help you maximize points effortlessly.

**Tip #3: Coordinate Fuel Redemptions with High Fuel Demand** 

To make the most out of your points, plan to redeem them when your tank is near empty. Since Fred Meyer allows you to redeem points to save up to $1 per gallon, using your points strategically when you need a full tank helps maximize savings. This approach works best for drivers who fill up frequently, as it provides more substantial savings on larger fill-ups. Additionally, try to redeem points closer to the end of the month to ensure you use all accumulated points before they expire. Setting reminders or tracking your points through the Fred Meyer app can help you stay on top of expiration dates.

**Tip #4: Use the Fred Meyer App to Track Your Points** 

The Fred Meyer app is a valuable tool for anyone looking to get the most out of the Fuel Points Program. Through the app, you can monitor your points balance in real-time, receive notifications on bonus point promotions, and track when points are due to expire. The app also features a fuel station locator, allowing you to find the nearest participating station for redeeming your points. Regularly checking the app before each shopping trip ensures you don’t miss out on any current offers, helping you stay informed and plan your purchases effectively.

**Tip #5: Shop with Seasonal and Weekly Ads** 

Every week, Fred Meyer releases ads that highlight current promotions, including items with bonus fuel points. Reviewing the weekly ad before shopping is an effective way to incorporate high-point items into your shopping list. Seasonal promotions, especially around holidays, often include bonus points on popular items like decorations, party supplies, or holiday-themed foods. Adjusting your shopping to align with these promotions is an easy way to increase your points balance without spending more.

**Tip #6: Optimize Pharmacy Points** 

If you have prescriptions to fill, consider transferring them to Fred Meyer’s pharmacy. This allows you to earn fuel points on necessary medication refills, enhancing your rewards without any additional purchases. Each prescription fill earns points, which can quickly add up if you or your family have regular medications. Some pharmacies even offer double points on prescriptions during special events, making it worth exploring how to incorporate pharmacy purchases into your fuel-saving strategy.

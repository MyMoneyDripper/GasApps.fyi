# The Complete Guide to Saving Money with Gas Apps

## 1. Start with Upside

The Upside app offers a straightforward way to save on gas without the hassle of special cards or codes. By partnering with gas stations, Upside gives you cash back on your fuel purchases. Here’s how it works: open the app to find a list of participating gas stations in the GetUpside program. Your potential savings will range from 10 cents to 35 cents per gallon, depending on the station you choose. Once you’ve selected a gas station, fill up your tank using any payment method, and snap a picture of your receipt. Upside will then calculate your savings and send the amount through PayPal.

Upside makes the process simple and user-friendly, focusing on convenience and immediate rewards. This app is particularly useful for those who want to save money on gas without committing to specific payment methods or loyalty cards. By offering a flexible and straightforward way to earn cash back, Upside has become a popular choice for savvy drivers looking to cut fuel costs.

To maximize your savings with Upside, consider planning your fill-ups based on the best available deals in your area. Regularly check the app for new offers and high-cashback stations. Over time, the savings can add up significantly, especially for those who drive frequently. Additionally, Upside often runs promotions that can further increase your savings, making it a valuable tool in your money-saving arsenal.

## 2. Pay with GasBuddy

GasBuddy offers another excellent way to save on gas with its Pay with GasBuddy program. When you sign up, you’ll receive a prepaid gas card linked to your checking account, allowing you to save on every fill-up at many gas stations nationwide. Free members can save up to 25 cents per gallon, while GasBuddy Premium members, who pay $9.99 per month, can save up to 40 cents per gallon. Premium membership also includes 24-hour roadside assistance from Allstate and exclusive GasBack offers.

Pay with GasBuddy provides significant savings without requiring major changes to your routine. Simply use the prepaid card at the pump, and the funds will be pulled directly from your checking account. The savings per gallon will vary depending on the location and the type of membership you have. This program is especially beneficial for those who drive frequently and want to ensure consistent savings on fuel.

For maximum savings, consider the premium membership if you drive enough to justify the monthly fee. The additional benefits, such as guaranteed savings and roadside assistance, add extra value to the program. Keep an eye on GasBack offers, which provide further discounts and rewards on gas purchases and other expenses, enhancing your overall savings strategy.

## 3. Gas Station Loyalty Programs

Most major gas station chains offer loyalty programs that reward frequent customers with discounts and points. Signing up for these programs typically involves providing your name and contact information, after which you’ll receive a member account number. You can use this number whenever you make purchases at the corresponding gas stations to earn immediate discounts or reward points.

These programs are highly beneficial as they can be combined with gas apps and gas station loyalty programs for even greater savings. For example, you can earn fuel points at Kroger while using Upside or GasBuddy to get additional cash back or discounts at the pump.

To maximize your savings, plan your grocery shopping around the fuel rewards program. Keep track of your points and understand the redemption rules to ensure you get the most out of your purchases. By integrating these programs with other gas-saving strategies, you can significantly reduce your overall fuel costs.

## 5. Combining Programs for Maximum Savings

To achieve the best possible savings at the pump, combine the strategies from the previous sections. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this effectively:

1. **Sign Up for Multiple Programs**: Register for Upside, GasBuddy, relevant gas station loyalty programs, and grocery fuel rewards programs.
2. **Plan Your Fill-Ups**: Use the Upside app to find gas stations offering the best cash back deals. Check if these stations are part of your gas station loyalty program.
3. **Use Your GasBuddy Card**: Pay with your GasBuddy card to save per gallon, even on top of the savings from Upside and loyalty programs.
4. **Redeem Grocery Rewards**: When you have enough points from your grocery store's fuel rewards program, use them at participating stations to save even more.
5. **Monitor and Maximize**: Regularly check all your apps and programs for new offers and promotions. Adjust your shopping and fueling habits to take full advantage of these deals.

For example, let’s say you’re filling up at a Shell station that participates in Upside and you have both Shell Fuel Rewards and Kroger Fuel Points. You find a Shell station offering 20 cents back per gallon on Upside. You use your GasBuddy card to pay, saving an additional 25 cents per gallon as a free member. On top of that, you redeem your Kroger Fuel Points for an additional discount. This multi-layered approach allows you to stack savings from different programs, maximizing your overall discount on fuel.

By combining these methods, you can significantly reduce your fuel expenses, ensuring you get the best value every time you fill up. This comprehensive approach leverages the strengths of each program, providing a robust strategy for saving money at the pump.

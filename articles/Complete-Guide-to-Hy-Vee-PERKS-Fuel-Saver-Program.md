### **Tips to Get the Most Out of the Hy-Vee Fuel Saver + Perks® Program**

The Hy-Vee Fuel Saver + Perks® program offers numerous ways to accumulate points and save on fuel. With strategic shopping, careful timing, and smart use of available resources, you can maximize your fuel discounts and enjoy added perks. Here are some tips to help you make the most of this program:

**Tip #1: Take Advantage of High-Point Items**

Certain products offer more points than standard purchases, often as part of a promotion. Look for these high-point items when planning your shopping list, especially during promotional events. For example, Hy-Vee frequently offers bonus points on items such as fresh produce, bakery items, and household essentials. By selecting high-point products, you can significantly increase your points total, allowing you to redeem fuel discounts faster.

**Tip #2: Plan Your Fill-Ups for Maximum Savings** 

Since the program allows you to redeem up to 20 gallons in a single transaction, aim to fill your tank when it's nearly empty. Redeeming points for larger fill-ups gives you the maximum savings per trip, which can be especially beneficial when fuel prices are high. This strategy helps you avoid making multiple trips to the gas station, thereby extending the value of each redemption.

**Tip #3: Keep Track of Expiration Dates** 

Hy-Vee Fuel Saver + Perks® points expire after 30 days, which means you need to use them promptly. Regularly check your point balance and set reminders to avoid losing points due to expiration. You can easily monitor expiration dates through the Hy-Vee app, which will help you make timely decisions on when to redeem and ensure that no points go to waste.

**Tip #4: Bundle Grocery Shopping with Fuel Savings** 

If you shop at Hy-Vee frequently, try to align your grocery trips with when you need gas. This approach allows you to earn points from your grocery purchases and redeem them at the pump on the same day, creating a seamless shopping and savings cycle. If your schedule allows, consider dedicating one day a week for both grocery shopping and filling up your gas tank to ensure efficient use of your rewards.

**Tip #5: Capitalize on Bonus Point Events** 

Throughout the year, Hy-Vee offers special events and promotions that allow you to earn double or even triple points on select items. Take advantage of these opportunities to accumulate points quickly. Look for promotions in the weekly Hy-Vee ad, on their website, or in your email. Stocking up on high-point items during bonus events can help you rack up points that translate into substantial fuel savings.

**Tip #6: Use the Hy-Vee Mobile App for Tracking and Offers** 

The Hy-Vee app is an essential tool for Fuel Saver + Perks® members, providing real-time access to your point balance, expiration dates, and available promotions. You can also access exclusive digital coupons and discounts, adding another layer of savings to your grocery bill. The app’s GPS feature makes it easy to locate nearby Hy-Vee gas stations and check their fuel prices, helping you plan your fuel stops strategically.

**Tip #7: Stack Savings with Manufacturer Coupons and Discounts** 
Combine the Hy-Vee Fuel Saver + Perks® points with manufacturer coupons or store-specific discounts to maximize your savings. While the program offers fuel rewards, Hy-Vee also provides other discounts through their in-store promotions. Using coupons alongside high-point purchases amplifies your savings on both groceries and fuel, giving you the best value for your money.

**Tip #8: Look Out for Seasonal Perks and Member-Exclusive Rewards** 
Hy-Vee occasionally provides special rewards for Fuel Saver + Perks® members, such as birthday discounts, holiday bonuses, and limited-time offers. These perks add extra value beyond fuel savings, so be sure to check your email or the app for notifications on available offers. Staying informed on these seasonal rewards will allow you to take full advantage of the program’s additional benefits.

**Tip #9: Stock Up on Everyday Essentials During Promotional Periods** 
When items like canned goods, cleaning supplies, and paper products come with extra points, consider stocking up. These essentials have a long shelf life and can help you earn substantial points without inflating your grocery bill. Planning ahead and stocking up on high-point items will allow you to enjoy long-term savings on fuel while keeping your pantry well-stocked.

**Tip #10: Join Hy-Vee's Mailing List for Updates** 
To stay in the loop about new promotions, exclusive perks, and bonus point opportunities, subscribe to Hy-Vee's mailing list. Emails often include updates on upcoming sales and promotions, helping you plan your shopping trips to maximize your rewards.

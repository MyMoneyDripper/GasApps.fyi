points can then be used to reduce the price per gallon of gas at Kroger
fuel centers or participating Shell stations. The program is free to

providing a significant opportunity to save money on fuel over time.

    Kroger\'s website to sign up for a Kroger Plus Card, which serves as
    your loyalty membership card.

    you\'ll link your Kroger Plus Card to your Kroger account, which
    allows you to track your purchases and fuel points.

    you fuel points.

### **How to Earn Kroger Fuel Points**

Earning Kroger Fuel Points is straightforward and can be done in several
ways:

-   **Groceries:** Earn 1 point per \$1 spent on groceries (excluding
    alcohol, tobacco, and other restricted items).

-   **Gift Cards:** Earn 2x or 4x points on select gift cards during
    promotional events.

-   **Pharmacy:** Earn points on qualifying prescriptions.

-   **Special Promotions:** Kroger regularly runs bonus point events for
    certain products or services.

-   **Online Orders:** Points are earned on pickup and delivery orders
    as well as in-store purchases.

### **Tips for Maximizing Earnings with the Kroger Fuel Points Program**

1.  **Buy Gift Cards for Regular Purchases:** Take advantage of Kroger's
    bonus point promotions on gift cards, where you can earn 2x, 4x, or
    even more points. Purchase gift cards for places you already shop,
    like Amazon, restaurants, or home improvement stores. You'll get
    extra fuel points without spending more money, making this one of
    the best ways to boost your balance.

2.  **Shop During Double or Triple Point Events:** Kroger frequently
    runs special promotions where you can earn extra points on specific
    product categories or during specific timeframes. Keep an eye out
    for these events by checking the Kroger app or weekly ads, and plan
    your grocery shopping around them to maximize your point earnings.

3.  **Use Digital Coupons to Save More:** Pair the Fuel Points program
    with Kroger's digital coupons to save even more money. These coupons
    don't affect your point balance and allow you to get discounts on
    your groceries, meaning more savings overall while still earning
    points for gas.

4.  **Consolidate Your Shopping:** To maximize fuel points, try
    consolidating your shopping into fewer, larger trips. For example,
    instead of doing small trips multiple times a week, do one big trip
    to rack up more points at once. The larger the grocery bill, the
    faster you accumulate points.

5.  **Use Pharmacy Services at Kroger:** You can earn additional points
    by filling qualifying prescriptions at Kroger pharmacies. Not only
    does this save you time by handling grocery and pharmacy needs in
    one trip, but it also adds to your point balance, giving you an
    extra avenue for fuel savings.

6.  **Stack Points from Multiple Months:** If you don't need fuel
    immediately, you can let points accumulate across two consecutive
    months. This allows you to combine points for larger savings when
    you're ready to redeem, potentially getting closer to that \$1 off
    per gallon maximum discount.

7.  **Plan Large Purchases at Kroger:** If you're planning a big
    purchase---like catering for a party or buying large quantities of
    groceries---consider doing it at Kroger to rack up substantial
    points quickly. Large single transactions can significantly boost
    your point balance, allowing for bigger fuel savings at the pump.

    lottery tickets do not earn points.

### **Final Remarks**

The Kroger Fuel Points program is a valuable tool for shoppers looking
to reduce their fuel costs. By earning points on everyday purchases like
groceries, prescriptions, and gift cards, customers can quickly
accumulate savings, making it especially useful for frequent Kroger
shoppers. The program's key advantage is its simplicity: points
automatically accumulate with regular shopping, and the fuel savings can
add up to \$1 off per gallon.

However, there are some downsides to consider: points expire quickly,
and redemption locations are somewhat limited. Additionally, the maximum
discount is capped, which may limit savings for those who accumulate a
lot of points. Despite these drawbacks, the program's flexibility,
frequent bonus opportunities, and ease of use make it a great option for
those already shopping at Kroger.

Overall, it's a practical way to save on gas, especially if you take
full advantage of the program\'s features.

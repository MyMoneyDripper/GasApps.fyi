### Tips to Maximize Your Savings with Tops GasPoints

Maximizing your GasPoints is more than just accumulating points—it’s about strategic shopping, careful planning, and taking advantage of the program's flexibility. Below, we’ll expand on the core tips and provide additional strategies to help you get the most out of your Tops Markets GasPoints program, potentially saving you hundreds of dollars annually on fuel costs.

**Tip #1: Use Manufacturer Coupons to Earn Bonus Points**

One of the most powerful strategies for maximizing GasPoints is the smart use of manufacturer coupons. Tops Markets incentivizes coupon use by offering 10 bonus GasPoints for each coupon redeemed, with a maximum of 100 bonus points per transaction. This bonus is on top of the points you earn from regular grocery purchases.

If you're a heavy coupon user, you can strategically split your purchases across multiple transactions. For instance, if you have 15 or 20 coupons, break up your shopping into two or more transactions to earn 100 bonus points per transaction rather than limiting yourself to just one. This can add up to 200-300 bonus points in a single shopping trip, significantly accelerating your GasPoints accumulation.

Additionally, keep an eye on weekly double coupon days or special promotions where certain brands or items may offer even higher bonus points. Consider combining these promotions with your regular coupons to maximize savings.

**Pro Tip:** Join online couponing communities or subscribe to Tops Markets' newsletter to stay updated on upcoming coupon promotions that can yield more points.

**Tip #2: Watch for Weekly GasPoints Promotions**

Tops Markets regularly runs GasPoints promotions, especially around major holidays, back-to-school season, and other special occasions. During these promotions, you can earn double or even triple points on select products, categories, or brands. If you know when these promotions are happening, you can time your shopping accordingly to maximize your points.

For example, during a special promotion, you might earn 2 or 3 GasPoints for every dollar spent on a particular brand or type of product. Stocking up on items like household goods, snacks, or beverages during these promotional periods can significantly boost your point accumulation without increasing your overall grocery budget.

To stay on top of these promotions, check your weekly Tops Markets flyer or download their app, where promotions are often highlighted. This simple habit can multiply your savings significantly over the course of the year.

**Pro Tip:** Plan your larger, bulk-shopping trips around GasPoints promotion weeks. Combining a bulk purchase with a promotional event could result in hundreds of extra points, turning a regular grocery haul into substantial fuel savings.

**Tip #3: Fill the Tank for Maximum Savings**

When redeeming your GasPoints, the discount applies to up to 25 gallons of fuel in a single transaction. This means that to maximize the value of your points, you should aim to fill up as close to 25 gallons as possible.

If you drive a vehicle with a smaller fuel tank or if you don’t typically use that much gas, consider bringing additional gas cans or coordinate with family members or friends to fill up multiple vehicles in a single visit. By doing this, you can maximize the discount on as much gas as possible, ensuring you're getting the most value out of each GasPoints redemption.

For example, if you’ve accumulated 500 GasPoints, you can reduce the price per gallon by $0.50. Filling up 25 gallons would give you $12.50 in savings. Even if your vehicle only holds 15 gallons, bringing along extra containers or filling up a second vehicle can help you fully utilize the potential savings.

**Pro Tip:** Know your vehicle’s fuel capacity. Try to time your fill-up when your tank is as empty as possible to make the most of the full 25-gallon redemption.

**Tip #4: Break Up Purchases for Multiple Redemptions**

Instead of doing one massive grocery haul each week, consider spreading out your purchases to maximize points and take advantage of more promotions. This tactic is especially useful if Tops Markets is running multiple point-boosting promotions on different weeks.

By breaking up your shopping into smaller, weekly transactions, you can earn more GasPoints by leveraging weekly promotions and spreading out coupon bonuses. This method ensures that you're earning points consistently without letting any potential savings slip by. Additionally, using coupons across multiple transactions ensures that you hit the 100 bonus point limit each time rather than capping out too early in a large purchase.

**Pro Tip:** If you have a large list of groceries to buy, plan them over several weeks to coincide with promotional periods. This method ensures you're getting bonus points for each week’s unique promotions rather than missing out by purchasing all at once.

**Tip #5: Coordinate Gas Fill-Ups with High Points Balances**

It’s wise to redeem your GasPoints once you’ve accumulated enough points to significantly reduce your fuel cost. For example, if you’ve earned 500 points, you can reduce the price per gallon by $0.50. The key here is timing: accumulate enough points to make a noticeable dent in your per-gallon cost and then redeem them when you need a full tank of gas.

If possible, coordinate with family members or friends when redeeming your points, especially if you're near the 25-gallon limit. Pool your vehicles or fuel needs so that you can fill up multiple tanks in one transaction and get the full value of the discount.

**Pro Tip:** Avoid small fill-ups when redeeming points. Try to time your visits to the gas station when both your car and any extra containers or second vehicles need to be filled. This way, you get the most savings for the 25-gallon limit.

**Tip #6: Stay Informed on Your GasPoints Balance**

An important factor in maximizing your savings is keeping track of your GasPoints balance and expiration dates. Points typically expire after a set period, so you want to be sure you’re using them before they disappear. You can check your points balance in several ways:

* At the bottom of your receipt after each purchase 
* Online through your Tops Markets BonusPlus® account* 
* Via the Tops Markets app

Knowing your current balance and expiration dates ensures you never miss out on potential savings. Plan your fill-ups around your balance and be aware of when your points will expire, so you don't leave savings on the table.

**Pro Tip:** Set reminders on your phone or keep a note in your planner for when your GasPoints are about to expire. This way, you can plan a trip to the gas station or even an extra shopping trip to use points before they vanish.

**Tip #7: Utilize Fuel Promotions for Maximum Fill-Up Value**

In addition to accumulating GasPoints through grocery shopping, Tops Markets sometimes runs special fuel promotions where you can earn extra savings or bonus points for purchasing specific types of fuel or brands of gas. These promotions are typically announced in advance, so make sure to stay informed through Tops' weekly ads or their mobile app.

Sometimes, these fuel promotions only last for a limited time or are available only on specific days. By taking advantage of these opportunities, you can stack additional savings on top of the GasPoints you’ve already accumulated, making your fuel purchases even more economical.

**Pro Tip:** During fuel promotion periods, aim to maximize the amount of fuel you purchase. If the promotion offers an additional $0.05 or $0.10 off per gallon, even small savings can add up when applied to a 25-gallon purchase.

By following these tips and strategies, you can significantly enhance the benefits you reap from the Tops Markets GasPoints program. The key is planning and awareness—by taking the time to strategically use coupons, watch for promotions, and maximize the value of your points, you can save hundreds of dollars annually on fuel while sticking to your regular grocery shopping routine.

### How to Redeem GasPoints

Redeeming GasPoints is easy and can be done at any participating Tops Gas Station. When you're at the pump, simply swipe your Tops BonusPlus® card, and the savings will be automatically applied to your fuel purchase. The more points you’ve accumulated, the bigger the discount you’ll receive per gallon.

**Pro Tip:** Since the discount applies to a maximum of 25 gallons, filling up multiple vehicles or bringing additional fuel containers can help you maximize the potential savings from each redemption.

* **Limited Redemption Locations:** While Tops Markets has its own gas stations, not all locations may offer fuel services, limiting where you can redeem your points.  
* **Cap on Manufacturer Coupons:** You can only earn 100 bonus points per transaction from manufacturer coupons, so it’s essential to manage your coupon usage effectively.

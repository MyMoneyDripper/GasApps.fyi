### **Tips to Get the Most Out of Fry’s Fuel Points Program**

The Fry’s Fuel Points Program provides an excellent way to save on fuel through smart shopping strategies. Here are several detailed tips to help you maximize your points balance, earn more points faster, and make the most of the discounts available to you:

#### **Tip #1: Plan Major Shopping Around Bonus Events**

Fry’s regularly holds bonus events where you can earn extra points on specific items, departments, or purchases that reach a certain dollar amount. By timing your larger grocery trips to coincide with these events, you can accumulate significantly more points per dollar spent. For example, if you know a bonus event is approaching, consider delaying large purchases until that period. Stock up on essentials, household items, and non-perishables during these events to boost your points balance rapidly. Also, check the store's weekly ad and website for information on bonus point days, as these promotions can provide opportunities for accelerated points accumulation.

#### **Tip #2: Track Points Expiration Dates**

Points accumulated through Fry’s Fuel Points Program expire at the end of the month following the one in which they were earned. To avoid losing unused points, develop a habit of checking your balance frequently—either on the Fry’s website or through the Fry’s app. Set a reminder on your calendar to check your points balance toward the end of each month, giving you ample time to redeem points before they expire. You can also create a shopping or fuel plan if your points are nearing expiration, ensuring you don’t lose out on savings.

#### **Tip #3: Use the Fry’s App for Exclusive Offers**

The Fry’s app is loaded with features to help you maximize your savings and keep track of your fuel points. You can easily monitor your points balance, get notifications on bonus events or limited-time offers, and locate participating fuel stations in your area. Additionally, the app often includes app-exclusive promotions, where you can earn extra points or access discounts not available to in-store shoppers. Make it a habit to check the app each time you shop so you don’t miss any exclusive deals or special promotions that can add to your points.

#### **Tip #4: Stack Digital Coupons with Points**

Many shoppers overlook the value of digital coupons, but stacking these with fuel points can lead to significant savings. Browse and load digital coupons in the Fry’s app before shopping; by combining these with fuel points, you can save money on your grocery bill while simultaneously earning points. This strategy is particularly effective during bonus point events, where additional purchases mean even greater fuel savings. Look out for offers that match your shopping list to maximize your discounts and point accumulation.

#### **Tip #5: Take Advantage of Gift Card Promotions**

Gift cards are an easy way to earn bonus points without increasing your grocery expenses. Fry’s frequently offers special point bonuses on gift card purchases, sometimes even doubling or tripling the points earned. You can buy gift cards for stores, restaurants, or other services that you already plan to use, allowing you to earn fuel points while budgeting for future expenses. Additionally, purchasing Fry’s gift cards to use for groceries is a clever way to earn points on your regular shopping.

#### **Tip #6: Utilize Pharmacy Purchases**

Every prescription filled at Fry’s pharmacy can earn you fuel points, making it a valuable option for those who require medications regularly. If you or family members need ongoing prescriptions, consider transferring them to Fry’s to take advantage of this benefit. Keep in mind that some pharmacies offer even higher point promotions for specific prescription medications, so inquire at your local Fry’s pharmacy for details on any special offers. It’s an easy way to earn points on necessary expenses without extra spending.

#### **Tip #7: Shop During Holidays for Extra Points**

During major holiday seasons, Fry’s often runs enhanced point promotions on certain products or minimum purchases. Plan to do your larger shopping trips around holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, the Fourth of July, or Memorial Day to capitalize on these offers. In addition to groceries, you can stock up on seasonal items or even holiday decorations to earn more points. Checking the Fry’s weekly ad for holiday promotions can give you insight into the best deals and point-boosting items.

#### **Tip #8: Join AARP for Additional Benefits**

If you’re an AARP member, you may be eligible for extra benefits through Fry’s loyalty program. Check for any special promotions that Fry’s might offer specifically for AARP members, as these promotions can include sign-up bonuses or additional discounts. This is an excellent way to earn extra points if you qualify and could give you an edge in maximizing your fuel savings. Be sure to inquire at customer service or check online for any Fry’s promotions linked to AARP membership.

#### **Tip #9: Purchase Qualifying Items with Higher Points**

Some products offer extra points when purchased, especially during promotional periods. Pay close attention to items labeled with double or triple points. Often, these items are essentials like household supplies, cleaning products, or even popular grocery items. By selecting these items when they’re available, you can increase your points balance more quickly. Before heading to the store, scan the Fry’s app or weekly ad for promotions on qualifying items that offer bonus points.

#### **Tip #10: Redeem Points Strategically**

To get the most out of your fuel points, consider redeeming them when fuel prices are at their highest. Gasoline prices fluctuate, and redeeming points during peak prices ensures maximum value for your points. If you track gas prices or have a general sense of when prices tend to rise, plan to fill up during those times. Additionally, if you have enough points saved, consider redeeming a larger amount (e.g., $1 off per gallon) in a single transaction to get the highest possible discount.

#### **Tip #11: Consolidate Shopping Trips**

Consolidating your shopping into fewer, larger trips rather than many smaller ones can help you accumulate points faster, especially during bonus events or promotions. By planning out your shopping list and buying in bulk, you not only maximize your fuel points but also save time and reduce the likelihood of impulse buys. This strategy is particularly helpful during weeks with double points offers, where a higher purchase amount translates to greater point accumulation.

#### **Tip #12: Use Fry's eCoupons for Extra Savings**

Fry's regularly updates its eCoupon offers. These digital coupons can be loaded onto your Fry’s loyalty card and applied automatically during checkout. By utilizing eCoupons alongside the Fry's fuel points, you can save on groceries while earning more points. For maximum savings, check for eCoupons that align with bonus point promotions or on items you frequently purchase.
